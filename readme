	This is the FASTEST brainfuck interpreter you will EVER see! it tries
	not to use the stack too much and only use registers for faster access
	to values! increible no?

	It is pretty simple, the first step is to make use the file exists and
	has permissions to read, then it will create a space into the heap to
	allocate there the content of the file, next step is to lex every token
	into the file (what is not a token is just skipped) and finally it starts
	to interpret the code YOU WROTEEE hopefully it will be correct!!

	The interpreter was implemented following some of the suggestions given
	in this page https://brainfuck.org/ (i also took some programs) to test
	the interpreter from there.

	happy sadness coding in bf!
